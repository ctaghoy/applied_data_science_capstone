# Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains the final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, which is the Applied Data Science Capstone Project.

## Project Description

The Applied Data Science Capstone Project is a culmination of all the skills and knowledge that I have acquired throughout the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. The project is designed to give hands-on experience in solving real-world problems using data science techniques.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to apply data science techniques to solve a real-world problem. In this case, the problem is related to the commercial space age and SpaceX. The project aims to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket based on public information and machine learning models.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `Data Collection API.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to collect data using the SpaceX REST API.
- `Data Collection with Web Scraping.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to collect data using web scraping techniques.
- `Data Wrangling.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to clean and preprocess data.
- `EDA with Data Visualization.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to perform exploratory data analysis using visualization techniques.
- `EDA with SQL.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to perform exploratory data analysis using SQL queries.
- `Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to perform interactive visual analytics using Folium.
- `Machine Learning Prediction.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build, tune, and evaluate classification models.
- `README.md`: This file.
